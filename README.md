# Plato&rsquo;s Cave

[![Main workflow](https://github.com/visiosto/cave/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/visiosto/cave/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Named after Plato&rsquo;s allegory of the cave, this project is used to generate
OpenGraph images for Visiosto&rsquo;s project during build. It uses
[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) as the flame that casts the shadow from HTML
template files.

The tool is written in JavaScript (using JSDoc) in order to work with Puppeteer
seamlessly.
